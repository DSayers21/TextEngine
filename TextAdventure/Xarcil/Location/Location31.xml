<LocName>Fishing Shack</LocName>
<LocDesc>Fishermen congregate in this exposed shack, resting on precarious stilts above the river, hoping to catch the giant leaping sturgeon that reside in this part of the river. The inside of the shack is bare, consisting only of a few small bunks an a small stove nested away in the corner. Outside the shack is a large balcony with a wooden railing. Fishing poles are lined up along it, their lures dangling down into the river.</LocDesc>
