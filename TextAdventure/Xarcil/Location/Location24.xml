<LocName>Bridge</LocName>
<LocDesc>This large and sturdy oaken bridge has stood the test of time. Although discoloured by algae and mould, itâ€™s structure remains strong. It Towers over the rushing river, providing safe passage over the torrential current bellow. It is a wonder, how after all this time, it still stands tall against the power of the water surging underneath it.</LocDesc>
