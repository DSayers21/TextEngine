<LocName>River 6</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is starting to slow down as the valley becomes wider and flatter, the once gushing torrent is now a calm meandering flow. Occasionally a large fish can be seen leaping over the surface of the water, these great salmon are the prize many fishermen dream of catching.</LocDesc>
