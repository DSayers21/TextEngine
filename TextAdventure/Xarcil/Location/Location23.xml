<LocName>River 5</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is a raging torrent of water gushing down from the mountains as a result of the summer thaw. It crashes down the valley with a force so powerful any attempt to cross would result in being swept away. The sound of the water crashing through the valley is almost deafening, nothing else can be heard of the thundering of the water.</LocDesc>
