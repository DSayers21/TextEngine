<LocName>Murky Mire</LocName>
<LocDesc>The air above the mire is stagnant and foul. The ground is covered in a thick, oozing, mud which releases a foul gas with every step. Deep in the pools of murky water littering the mire, the eyes of the poor souls who had the misfortune to die in this dank place can sometimes be seen, staring up from the depths, before disappearing into the mirk.</LocDesc>
