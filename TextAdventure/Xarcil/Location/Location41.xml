<LocName>Hillside 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>A sprawl of rolling hills cover the land. There is a gentle breeze blowing calmly across the slopes and the sun shines warmly illuminating the hillside in a pale golden light. On the top of one of the hills is a mysterious ring of mushrooms with a number of small animal tracks that lead a short distance away before mysteriously vanishing.</LocDesc>
