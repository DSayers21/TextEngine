<LocName>Flood Plains 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The ground around the river is boggy and sodden. After heavy rain, the river swells and floods this area, covering it in water. Making growing crops or building structures almost impossible, as it spends large parts of the year entirely underwater. Part way along the river bank, some large webbed foot prints can be seen leading away from the river before vanishing without trace.</LocDesc>
