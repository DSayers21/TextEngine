<LocName>River 4</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is a raging torrent of water gushing down from the mountains as a result of the summer thaw. It crashes down the valley with a force so powerful any attempt to cross would result in being swept away. At times when the waves momentarily subside, the calm blue of the water can be seen beneath the chaos of the crashing waves.</LocDesc>
