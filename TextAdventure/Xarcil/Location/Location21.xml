<LocName>River 3</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is a raging torrent of water gushing down from the mountains as a result of the summer thaw. It crashes down the valley with a force so powerful any attempt to cross would result in being swept away. The ferocity of the water is similar to that of a great bear, charging down the valley.<LocDesc>
