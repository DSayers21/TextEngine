<LocName>River 2</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is a raging torrent of water gushing down from the mountains as a result of the summer thaw. It crashes down the valley with a force so powerful any attempt to cross would result in being swept away. The valley turns at an almost impossible angle, with the river still raging through. The bend is not of natural creation, it looks like long ago this valley was stopped in its tracks by a being of immense power.</LocDesc>
