<LocName>Valley (of Death)</LocName>
<LocDesc>Although a faint draught can be felt blowing through the valley, it remains filled by a dense unnatural mist. The mist is so thick that it is impossible to see more than a couple of feet in any direction. The looming rocks of the valley walls lunge out of the mist like giant stone gargoyles.</LocDesc>
