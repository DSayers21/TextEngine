<LocName>Corn Field 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The field is filled with tall corn plants as far as the eye can see. They reach up into the sky, nearly 10 feet tall, covering vast areas of land like a vast impenetrable maze. At the centre of this field is a large lifeless scarecrow seen sticking up above the corn. </LocDesc>
