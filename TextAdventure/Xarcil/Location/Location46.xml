<LocName>Logging Hut</LocName>
<LocDesc>Inside the hut is a warm hearth and a table covered in a variety of roasted meats and different cheeseâ€™s. Hung on one of the walls is the head of a large elk above a mantle piece. The constant coming and going of loggers means there is never a dull moment in this seemingly innocent lumberjack community.</LocDesc>
