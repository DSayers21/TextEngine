<LocName>Forest 6</LocName>
<LocDesc>The forest is dense, the trees are high and their roots run deep. The air is close and the leaves of the trees block out most of the light casting a dark shadow over everything in sight. At the base of a particularly large tree is a very soft patch moss just below a whole in the trunk.</LocDesc>
