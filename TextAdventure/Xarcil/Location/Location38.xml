<LocName>Forrest 13</LocName>
<LocDesc>The tall pine trees on the outskirts of this vast forest sway gently in the wind. The woodland here seems friendly and inviting, but deeper in, the tops of the trees writhe and move like something inside is stirring. Wild mushrooms can be seen growing at the bases of the trees, they grow to unnatural sizes like they have some sort of miracle fertiliser. The farmer would love to get this hands on some of that!</LocDesc>
