<LocName>Gentle Steam 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The ebb and flow of the water in this gentle stream combined with the soft glow of the sun create a truly tranquil atmosphere. Along the riverbanks, the grass is green and lush, small fish can be seen swimming about in the shallows near the shore. The stream is only a few inches deep in places with small, perfectly round, stones lying in amongst the reeds on the steam bed.</LocDesc>
