<LocName>Forest 14</LocName>
<LocDesc>The tall pine trees on the outskirts of this vast forest sway gently in the wind. The woodland here seems friendly and inviting, but deeper in, the tops of the trees writhe and move like something inside is stirring. Squirrels and other small animals can be seen darting around, going about their business amongst the foliage.</LocDesc>
