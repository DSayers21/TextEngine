<LocName>Flood Plains 2</LocName>
<LocDesc>The ground around the river is boggy and sodden. After heavy rain, the river swells and floods this area, covering it in water. Making growing crops or building structures almost impossible, as it spends large parts of the year entirely underwater. Some of the rocks near the shore are dry, but the ground around them is wet from recent flooding.</LocDesc>
