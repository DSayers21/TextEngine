<LocName>Forrest 11</LocName>
<LocDesc>The tall pine trees on the outskirts of this vast forest sway gently in the wind. The woodland here seems friendly and inviting, but deeper in, the tops of the trees writhe and move like something inside is stirring. High atop the pines the occasional buzzard can be seen soaring on the draughts of hot air looking for prey.</LocDesc>
