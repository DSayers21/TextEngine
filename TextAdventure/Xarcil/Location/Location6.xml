<LocName>Waterlogged Field</LocName>
<LocDesc>Once a field full of crops, this field is now boggy and sodden with water. It is slowly being swallowed by the marsh and the encroaching river. The once fertile land is now barren and empty, it is no longer possible to grow crops in the field as if all of the life has been washed out of the soil.</LocDesc>
