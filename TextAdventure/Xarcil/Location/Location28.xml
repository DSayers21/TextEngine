<LocName>Grotto</LocName>
<LocDesc>A mysterious grotto, at itâ€™s centre is a huge ancient willow tree. It branches span all around and droop so low they form a giant curtain of green. Within its veil, an aura of life can be felt everywhere fighting back against the dark and lifeless swamp. At the base of the trees trunk is a glimmering green light, radiating off the bark as if the very essence of its life was radiating out from it.</LocDesc>
