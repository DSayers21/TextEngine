<LocName>Cobbled Road 3</LocName>
<LocDesc>The old cobbled road was once busy with carts and horses, but now is seldom used. All the trade has left these parts and the heavy duty road now only sees the occasional traveller. At the end of the road is what remains of an old wooden stables, the roof has fallen in and only one of the walls is left fully intact.</LocDesc>
