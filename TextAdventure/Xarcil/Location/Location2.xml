<LocName>Old Inn</LocName>
<LocDesc>The inn is almost empty apart from a drunken looking patron passed out in the corner, and the weary looking inn keeper stood behind the bar. There is the pleasant smell of something cooking coming from a kitchen just out of sight. The inn looks like its last legs and could do with a good lick of paint.</LocDesc>
