<LocName>Cross Roads</LocName>
<LocDesc>A large oak tree stands just to one side of the cross roads with numerous signs nailed to it, many have become so badly damaged the writing on them is almost illegible. One sign, which looks far more recent than the rest, reads “Poor people have it, rich people need it, if you eat it you die, what am I?”.</LocDesc>
