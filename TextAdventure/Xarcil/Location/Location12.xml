<LocName>Cobbled Road 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The old cobbled road was once busy with carts and horses, but now is seldom used. All the trade has left these parts and the heavy duty road now only sees the occasional traveller. This long straight road disappears off into the distance as far the eye can see.</LocDesc>
