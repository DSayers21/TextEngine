<LocName>Marsh 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The ground underfoot is boggy and wet. There are small channels of water trickling between grassy mounds of earth and clumps reeds protruding from shallow pools of stagnant water. Apparently the leeches of the marsh have uses in medicine to cure the blood from toxins.</LocDesc>
