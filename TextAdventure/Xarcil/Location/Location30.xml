<LocName>River 1</LocName>
<LocDesc>The river is a raging torrent of water gushing down from the mountains as a result of the summer thaw. It crashes down the valley with a force so powerful any attempt to cross would result in being swept away. Sometimes when the light hits the water in just the right way, the crashing waves can be seen to take the appearance of galloping horses.</LocDesc>
