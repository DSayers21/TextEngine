<LocName>Forrest 12</LocName>
<LocDesc>The tall pine trees on the outskirts of this vast forest sway gently in the wind. The woodland here seems friendly and inviting, but deeper in, the tops of the trees writhe and move like something inside is stirring. Somewhere up in the branches of one of the trees nearby, the sound of a sparrow cracking an acorn against a branch reverberates around the tree tops.</LocDesc>
