<LocName>Cave</LocName>
<LocDesc>The cave is very dark and damp, there are large stalactites looming down the from the roof like giant monstrous teeth. There is a constant drip of water echoing throughout as it splashes against the hard stone floor. At the back of the cave is a pitch black tunnel leading down into the ground, it is too dark to see how far it goes.</LocDesc>
